> A Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for analyzing your Instagram profile data. GUI coming soon.

Hi! You'll need to request Instagram to send you your data before you can analyze it using this notebook. To do that, go to the Instagram app > Settings > Security > Download Data.

Instagram will ask you for your email, and it will send it there in a few hours (Getting your data may take some time). After you get it, come back here. Open the Instagram_Data_Analysis.ipynb notebook. Once you have your data ready, you will find further instructions in the notebook itself. Click on the 'Open with Colab' button to start.
